# Lab 8a: Custom Machine Learning Project Implementation

This lab involves designing and executing a machine learning project using one of three datasets: Census Income, Airbnb NYC listings, or World Happiness Report. The process follows the full ML lifecycle from data exploration to model training and improvement.

## Dataset Options

| Dataset                  | Description                                                  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Census Income            | Demographic and income data for predicting income brackets. |
| Airbnb Listings NYC      | NYC Airbnb data for predictive modeling tasks.              |
| World Happiness Report   | Global happiness indicators for regression or classification.|

## Objectives

- Select a dataset and define a specific ML problem  
- Load and explore the data with EDA  
- Define a project plan based on insights  
- Prepare data for modeling (cleaning, feature engineering)  
- Fit a model to training data and evaluate performance  
- Iteratively improve the model based on evaluation

## Methodology

1. Data loading and exploration  
2. Problem definition and project planning  
3. Data preparation and feature engineering  
4. Model selection, training, and evaluation  
5. Model tuning and improvement
